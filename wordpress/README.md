# Quick Start

This repository includes the necessary files to package and deploy [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org/), an open source content management system, into on-prem, public or private cloud environments using [Gravity](http://gravitational.com/gravity/).  

This manifest uses the Open Elastic Block Store ([OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/) built into Gravity 7.X.

# System Requirements


* A x86_64 Linux machine or a VM for building a Cluster Image that is running one of the [supported Linux distributions](requirements.md#linux-distributions).
* Docker version 17 or newer. Run `docker info` before continuing to make sure
  you have Docker up and running. We recommend following instructions on [installing Docker CE from Docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* You must be a member of the `docker` group. Run `groups` command to make sure
  `docker` group is listed. If not, you can add yourself to the "docker" group via `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
* You must have `git` installed to clone the example application repo.
* At least one Linux node. . The nodes in a target cluster must have at least 2GB of RAM and 40GB of free disk space. They must **_not_** have Docker.
* You must have `sudo` privileges on all nodes.


## Step 1 Getting the Tools

Start by [downloading Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity/download/) and
unpacking the archive. You should see the following files:

```
$ ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 108093824 Apr 22 11:43 gravity
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user       137 Apr 22 11:43 install.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user     11357 Apr 22 11:43 LICENSE
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user      2880 Apr 22 11:43 README.md
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user  84764672 Apr 22 11:43 tele
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user  57863592 Apr 22 11:43 terraform-provider-gravity
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user  32488888 Apr 22 11:43 tsh
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user         6 Apr 22 11:43 VERSION
```

Execute `install.sh` to copy `tele` and `tsh` binaries to
`/usr/local/bin/`. Then you can type `tele version` to confirm that
everything works:

```
$ tele version
Edition:        open-source
Version:        7.0.1
Git Commit:     af393fcddf8c675f00cf322ec054125d5e239727
Helm Version:   v2.15
```
Clone the sample Git repository which contains the Kubernetes resources for
[Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org/), which we are using in this tutorial as a sample application:

```bsh
$ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/quickstart.git
$ cd quickstart
```
### Step 2: Creating the Kubernetes Resources

Making Wordpress run on Kubernetes is easy. The quickstart repository you have
cloned above includes the YAML definitions of Kubernetes objects. We'll use
a Helm chart for this:

```
$ tree wordpress/resources/charts/wordpress/
wordpress/resources/charts/wordpress/
├── Chart.yaml
├── templates
│   ├── _helpers.tpl
│   ├── mysql-deployment.yaml
│   ├── secret.yaml
│   └── wordpress-deployment.yaml
└── values.yaml

```

The values.yaml specifies several important values including
  - Using OpenEBS for storage
  - Size of the Persistent Storage for Wordpress and MySQL
  - Password for MySQL db.
You are welcome to modify this file and you can use --set and --values in the tele build process to replace these values. In this tutorial, we are packaging a single Helm chart but it is possible to have several of them packaged into a single Cluster Image.


### Step 3: Building the Cluster Image
Let's build the cluster image:

```bsh
$ tele build -o wordpress.tar wordpress/resources/app.yaml
Mon Apr 27 00:49:02 UTC Building cluster image wordpress 0.0.1
Mon Apr 27 00:49:02 UTC Selecting base image version
        Will use base image version 7.0.1

        Still downloading dependencies from s3://hub.gravitational.io (10 seconds elapsed)
        Still downloading dependencies from s3://hub.gravitational.io (20 seconds elapsed)

        Vendored image gravitational/debian-tall:stretch
        Vendored image gravitational/debian-tall:buster
        Vendored image gravitational/provisioner:ci.82
        Vendored image mysql:5.6
        Vendored image wordpress:4.8-apache

        Still creating application (10 seconds elapsed)
Mon Apr 27 00:51:36 UTC Generating the cluster image
Mon Apr 27 00:51:44 UTC Saving the image as wordpress.tar
        Still saving the image as wordpress.tar (10 seconds elapsed)
Mon Apr 27 00:52:02 UTC Build finished in 3 minutes 
```

Let's review what just happened. `tele build` did the following:

* Downloaded Kubernetes binaries and Gravity tooling from Gravitational distribution hub.
* Scanned the current directory and the subdirectories for Kubernetes resources and Helm charts.
* Downloaded external container images referenced in the resources discovered in the previous step.
* Packaged (or vendored) Docker images into the Cluster Image.
* Removed the duplicate container image layers, reducing the size of the Cluster Image.
* Saved the Cluster Image as `wordpress.tar`.

Note: Slow Operation Warning
    `tele build` needs to download hundreds of megabytes of binary dependencies which
    can take a considerable amount of time, depending on your Internet connection speed.

The resulting `wordpress.tar` file is about 2.9GB and it is **entirely
self-sufficient** and dependency-free. It contains everything: the Kubernetes
binaries, the Docker engine, the Docker registry and the Wordpress application itself:
everything one needs to get Wordpress up and running on any fleet of Linux
servers (or into an AWS/GCE/Azure account).

Congratulations! You have created your first **Kubernetes virtual appliance**!

## Step 4 Installing

Installing the `wordpress.tar` Cluster Image results in creating a Kubernetes
cluster with the application pre-loaded. This file is the only artifact
one needs to create a Kubernetes cluster with Wordpress running inside.

Copy `wordpress.tar` to a clean Linux machine. Let's call it `host`. This node
will be used to bootstrap the cluster. Let's untar it and look inside:

```bash
$ tar -xf wordpress.tar
$ tree
├── app.yaml
├── gravity
├── gravity.db
├── install
├── packages
│   ├── blobs
│   │   ├── 0e1
│   │   ...

│   ├── tmp

```


### Installing via CLI

To install a Cluster via CLI, you have to execute the `./gravity install` command and
supply three flags:

Flag              | Description
-------------------|---------------------------------
`--token`          | A secret token of your choosing which will be used to add additional nodes to this Cluster in the future. We'll use word "secret" here.
`--advertise-addr` | The IP address this host will be visible on by other nodes in this Cluster. We'll use `10.5.5.28`.
`--cloud-provider` | Whether in a specific cloud environment or a no-cloud provider such as standalone VMs/bare-metal environment [generic aws gce] We'll use `generic` here.  

The command below will create a single-node Kubernetes cluster with Wordpress running inside:

```
# We are executing this on the node named 'host' with IP address of 10.5.5.28
$ sudo ./gravity install \
        --advertise-addr=10.5.5.28 \
        --token=secret \
        --cloud-provider=generic
# Output:
Sun Apr 26 23:55:11 UTC Starting enterprise installer

To abort the installation and clean up the system,                                                                                                                                                                                              
press Ctrl+C two times in a row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                

If you get disconnected from the terminal, you can reconnect to the installer                                                                                                                                                                   
agent by issuing 'gravity resume' command.                                                                                                                                                                                                      

If the installation fails, use 'gravity plan' to inspect the state and                                                                                                                                                                          
'gravity resume' to continue the operation.

Navigate to `http://<node ip>:30080` to access the application.
  
  This is powered by the following service:
```
$ sudo kubectl get service wordpress
NAME        TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
wordpress   NodePort   100.100.204.73   <none>        80:30080/TCP   75m
```

**Note** that this is a single node deployment example.  You have the option of [joining](https://gravitational.com/gravity/docs/cluster/#adding-a-node) or installing with a different flavor.  The default flavor for this Cluster Manifest is small (1 node).  Other flavors include medium (3 nodes) and large (5 nodes). 
```
#Ex:

$ sudo ./gravity install \
        --advertise-addr=10.5.5.28 \
        --token=secret \
        --cloud-provider=generic \
        --flavor=medium
```

Flavor details are in the Wordpress [Cluster Manifest](./resources/app.yaml) . Flavors provide for specifying the number and configuration of nodes for a deployment.
